        <h1 style="text-align:center;">Coretta T. McCarter, Ed.D.</h1>
        <p>Dr. Coretta McCarter is an educational leader who has held various education positions ranging
            from general and special education teacher, district administrator, consultant, and education
            specialist for the Massachusetts Department of Elementary and Secondary Education.
            Combining her love of finance with education she is a Director of grants, where she successfully
            manages over $15 million in local, state and federal funding while promoting equity for diverse
            populations.
            <br>
            <br> Coretta works assiduously to elevate the voices of underrepresented and misrepresented people.
            She promotes the importance of integrating the perspective of others in order to improve best
            practices in education, businesses and organizations. Her experiences have allowed her the
            opportunity to collaborate with a diverse group of people to meet the common goal of increasing
            student achievement and well-being. Dr. McCarter’s commitment to public service, whether in
            practice or policy, includes the following foundational pillars: (1) leading with integrity, (2)
            encouraging and building capacity in others, (3) student-centered learning aligned to goals and
            expectations, and (4) solution focused approaches to addressing issues or problems.
            <br>
            <br> Coretta completed her Certificate of Advance Graduate Studies (CAGS) and doctorate degree in
            Educational Leadership at American International College. She started her educational career in
            New York City public schools. A product of New York City Public Schools, she uses her
            firsthand experience to remind organizations of the impact they have on others and the
            implications of omitting the populations the were designed to serve. Throughout her career in
            public education, she became an advocate for equal access to high-quality public education
            regardless of a student’s race, gender, or area code. Her educational philosophy is based on her
            uncompromising belief that all students can learn, given a positive learning environment, strong
            and knowledgeable leadership, a committed and focused educational team, and an encouraging
            community.
